# Blank extranet for GitHub Pages

Turns out GitHub pages is aaaaalmost good enough to host my silly
little extranet boilerplate. Mainly it only hides file extensions
for `.html` and `.xhtml`, and will naturally ignore any of my other
stuff.

Obviously the files can't be UUIDs as there is no rewrite capability.
The `<base href="..."/>` on all the files will have to be rewritten
to reflect the new URL.
